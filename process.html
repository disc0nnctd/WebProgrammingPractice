<h2>The Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>The witchers-to-be are subjected to intense alchemical processes, consumption of mutagenic compounds, and relentless physical and magical training to make them dangerous and highly versatile against their vast array of opponents, many of which possess superhuman speed, strength and/or other deadly powers. These procedures ultimately mean that each fully-trained witcher is a mutant built specifically to hunt and kill inhuman prey.</li>

<li>The witcher trials are primarily a series of three grueling stages in the witcher training process. First comes The Choice, which involves dietary changes and grueling physical training. Young witchers are taught sword skill, monster lore and herbalism. The main trials are as follows:</li>
<ol>
<li><i>The Trial of the Grasses,</i> which involves consuming various alchemical ingredients, or "the grasses" and affected the nervous system.</li>
<li><i>The Trial of the Dreams,</i> which involves the mutation of the eyes, bone marrow and hormones, allowed for better night vision, among other benefits. It also results in infertility.</li>
<li><i>The Trial of the Mountains,</i> which is more of a witcher exam. Only boys who were unlikely to undergo total mutation were administered this test. It is primarily intended to verify whether the candidate remembered anything from the prior Trial of the Grasses.</li>
</ol>
<li> The Witchers are taught about strengths and weaknesses of various monsters from the <i>Beastiary</i> and provided with recipes of potions and decoctions to fight monsters.</li>
</ul>
