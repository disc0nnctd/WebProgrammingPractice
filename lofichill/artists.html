					<p>By mixing heart touching piano, organic percussions and realistic ambient sounds and textures, <code>idealism</code> manages to reach deep into the hearts of the listeners, and take them on a self-reflecting musical journey. Emerging from the lofi/chill hiphop community, idealism has found a way to take the genre even further, by focusing on making the listener feel multiple emotions in one track, by combining techniques from ambient, jazz, downtempo and hiphop.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kudasaibeats">Kudasai</a></h3>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDpoBc8t6gE" width="420" height="315" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><code>Kudasai</code> represents the sappier, sentimental side of lo-fi hip-hop, often featuring vocals that stress the emotional isolation of his tracks. A lot of the microgenre’s success has come from tuning into a certain melancholy in younger people, helping them to deal with issues such as crushes and mental health problems. With an often bare-approach to song-building, sometimes featuring nothing less than a guitar, drums and atmospheric sounds, Kudasai’s tracks are raw and heartfelt.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://soundcloud.com/jinsangbeats">Jinsang</a></h3>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jGPypPNEg4" width="420" height="315" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><code>Jinsang</code> is a low-profile beatmaker who specializes in idyllic, slightly dazed left-field hip-hop tracks with elements sourced from dusty soul and jazz recordings. With a strong focus on contrasting textures, his beats will often feature both earthy drum patterns against ethereal melodies. While lo-fi hip-hop is more about instrumentals than actual rapping, Jinsang will often drop in a brief vocal sample from classic 90s hip-hop. The effect of this is to create a hazy, nostalgic memory of the genre’s golden age, imbuing his beats with a certain type of wistfulness.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://soundcloud.com/nymano">Nymano</a></h3>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/scyE0cl-T4k" width="420" height="315" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><code>Nymano</code>'s titles evoke a certain kind of sentimental sadboy mood, often using jazzy, soul-searching melodies one can easily reminisce about past relationships to. And his beat tapes aren’t merely a collection of tracks, but expertly meld into one another, creating a kind of emotional narrative.</p>
