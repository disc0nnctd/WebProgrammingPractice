		<h2>Who is a witcher?</h2>
		<p>A witcher also known as a wiccan, hexer, vedymin, or witchman (Elder Speech: vatt'ghern), is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning, and mysterious rituals (which take place at "witcher schools") in preparation for becoming an itinerant monster slayer for hire.</p>
		<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		<p>The witcher schools are the organizations which train and equip witchers, the itinerant monster slayers. While schools differ in mindset and details of training, most of them teach equally professional hunters. Headquartered in seclude locations, each one is built on the blood, sweat, and tears of countless children who stood within them, honing their technique and skill.</p>
		<p>Split off from the original Order of Witchers created in the 10th century, the schools continue to train new generations of witchers. Most of them had fallen up to the first half of the 13th century under various human attacks, but at least some of them were rebuilt and continued to function even in the 14th century.</p> <img src="assets\img\schools\medallions.jpg"> </div>
